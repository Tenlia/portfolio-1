As a visitor I want the portfolio to be concise and a product that showcases the developer's creativity and skill set.

As a visitor I want the entire site as well as the navigation to be responsive so that it's accessible and properly displayed on any screen size of the device that is being used.

As a developer I need to use proper semantic markup to reflect my skill level.
